#Modern UI demo for @wdhoges

This is a demo application using the mui tools for WPF to demonstrate how to save the user's selection for Accent, Font Size and Theme into local app settings.

This is provided principally just as an example working solution for @wdhodges, it does not include MVVM, although since this issue is focused entirely on the "View", I think dealing with it in code-behind is acceptable.
